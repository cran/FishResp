#' FishResp: Analytical Tool for Aquatic Respirometry
#'
#' Calculates metabolic rate of fish and other aquatic organisms measured using an intermittent-flow respirometry approach. The tool is used to run a set of graphical QC tests of raw respirometry data, correct it for background respiration and chamber effect, filter and extract target values of absolute and mass-specific metabolic rate. Experimental design should include background respiration tests and measuring of one or more metabolic rate traits. The package allows a user to import raw respirometry data obtained from AquaResp (free software), 'AutoResp' (LoligoSystems), 'OxyView' (PreSens), 'Pyro Oxygen Logger' (PyroScience) and 'Qbox-Aqua' (QubitSystems).
